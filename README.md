# SMS-Spam-Detection-with-DistilBERT-and-Hugging-Face-Trainer-

 Built a binary text classification model using distilbert-base-uncased to classify SMS messages as spam or 
non-spam.
 Preprocessed and tokenized messages using Hugging Face tokenizer with truncation and dynamic padding.
 Converted tokenized data to Hugging Face Dataset objects and fine-tuned a DistilBERT model using the 
Trainer API.
